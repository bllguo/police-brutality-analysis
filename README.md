Probabilistic analysis of police brutality across the United States. Project for UPenn STAT 476 - Probability Models.

Police brutality, an ugly issue brought to the limelight by several high-profile cases in the past few years, is an example of a social issue that people were unable to quantify and examine meaningfully until recently. New centralized efforts for monitoring police shootings and other violent incidents have produced a wealth of data, with which we can extract information about crime and violent police incidents.
In this study, data on deaths caused by law enforcement in the U.S. in 2015-2016 is analyzed. Using a NBD (Negative Bionomial Distribution) model, we will formulate conclusions about particularly violent months of the year, and differences in violent tendencies among police forces in different states. Hopefully, through this exercise, actionable insights can be produced to tackle one of the pricklier issues in the public consciousness.
